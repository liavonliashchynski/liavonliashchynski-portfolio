            Hi, I'm Liavon â€” a Junior Fullstack Developer with hands-on
            experience in building web applications using React.js, Redux,
            TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I specialize in creating
            dynamic, responsive, and scalable applications. On the frontend, I
            use React and TypeScript to build component-based UIs, with Redux
            for state management. On the backend, I develop RESTful APIs using
            Express.js and connect them to relational databases like MySQL. I
            enjoy working across the full stack and constantly improving my
            skills by building real-world projects, diving into new tools, and
            following clean code principles. Currently, I'm looking for
            opportunities to join a team where I can grow as a developer,
            contribute to meaningful projects, and keep pushing my knowledge
            forward.
